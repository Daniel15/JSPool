JSPool
======

JSPool facilitates easy integration of JavaScript scripting into a .NET 
application in a scalable and performant manner. It does so by creating a pool
of engines that can be reused multiple times. This makes it easy to use 
JavaScript libraries that have long initialisation times without having to 
create a new engine every time.

It is powered by the [JavaScriptEngineSwitcher](https://github.com/Taritsyn/JavaScriptEngineSwitcher)
library.
